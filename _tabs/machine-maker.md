**Machine Maker** is an editing system for creating _Frame system specification documents_. Frame is a markdown language that helps software architects and developers quickly and easily define state machines that capture the core system logic.

At the heart of Machine Maker is the [**Framepiler**](https://framepiler.frame-lang.org). The Framepiler is an open source transpiler written in Rust and bundled with Machine Maker. The Framepiler takes Frame specs and generates both UML documentation and state machines in 6 programming languages (with more to come!).

This version of **Machine Maker** generates the following languages:

* C++
* C#
* GDScript
* Java
* JavaScript
* Python
