## Your Journey with Thinking Different

In 1997 Apple Computer adopted a now iconic advertising campaign called "Think Different". It's revolutionary call unleashed a business and technical upheaval that we are still watching unfold today.

Despite the name, however, that campaign mainly encouraged new patterns of consumption. Frame, however, truly requires new patterns of thought.

## The State of the Art - Data Space

Frame's primary function is to turn the operation of an object-oriented class inside out. Consider this picture:

Though many younger people have never seen a negative (left), it is what is actually created by a light camera on film. To get a picture, the developing process literally inverts the color profile of the picture to make a final print.

Languages like Fortran and
Object-oriented classes are the descendants of programming languages focused on data structures. At the heart of each class is a data record, cocooned in a library of dedicated, protective functions called methods. Despite the "syntactic sugar" of OO languages, the first-class entities of the paradigm remain much the same as in the 1950s - data records and functions that manipulate them.


## The Art of the State - Solution Space

In contrast, Frame makes _context_ a first-class entity - in fact, *the* first-class entity of the language. In doing so, Frame forces the architect to think about the logical sequence of contexts that the system will pass through as the most important aspect of the development exercise.

 Solution Space Thinking

 ## Frame is _not_ a Framework!

 It is actually very easy to start to use Frame on existing projects, much less new ones. Why? Because _Frame is not a Framework_.

 Let me repeat - Frame is not a Framework and does not dictate anything about how your project is structured or organized. Instead, Frame is a language for defining how to turn object-oriented classes into a state machines. That's it!

 Therefore, introducing Frame into an existing project can be done class-by-class. This means you can incorporate Frame controllers as much or as little as you want - they just fit right in!
