While this site is gelling, I am keeping a FAQ post to log answers to questions I'm getting.

## Comments

Currently Frame only has single line comments which start with three dashes:

```
--- this is a comment
--- this is another one
```

Be aware - comment output in code is currently basically broken.

I know.

## Punctuation

I am doing an active experiment in seeing if I can extinguish commas and semicolons from the language. I'm not utterly dogmatic on it but I want to give it a good go and see if I can't repattern people to use the syntactic separator that they are using right **now** reading this sentence - the whitespace.

We'll see.
